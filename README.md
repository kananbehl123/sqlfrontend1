I'm excited to share that I've completed my journey through the fundamentals of HTML and CSS — the building blocks of the web! 🌐

✅ Learned how to structure content using HTML
✅ Styled pages beautifully with CSS
✅ Built responsive layouts and practiced with real-world projects
✅ Applied my skills by designing the frontend for our latest project: Optimizing E-commerce Deliveries with SQL

This is just the beginning of my web development journey, and I’m now diving into JavaScript next! 🚀

If you have project ideas or learning resources to recommend, I’d love to hear from you! Let’s connect and grow together.
